# Search Exercise #

* Login into your ElasticSearch sandbox
* Make sure elastic search is running:
```
sudo service elasticsearch restart
```
* Populate few orders:
```
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/ordering/order/2 -d '
{"id": "2", "placedOn": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "status": "pending"}'
```
```
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/ordering/order/3 -d '
{"id": "3", "placedOn": "2016-10-01T00:00:00Z", "status": "shipped"}'
```
```
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/ordering/order/4 -d '
{"id": "4", "placedOn": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z", "status": "received"}'
```
* Confirm there are some records to search on:
```
curl 'localhost:9200/ordering/order/_search?pretty=true'
```
* How many documents did you find?
* How do you know whether got all the documents or just first page of records?
* How do you find all orders that were shipped?
* What is the order of results?
* How do you <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-sort.html" target="_blank">sort</a> result using arbitrary field?
* Pick couple of options and run your sort query
* Reformat your query to use query uri instead of query json
* You will be asked to present your sort findings to others...
