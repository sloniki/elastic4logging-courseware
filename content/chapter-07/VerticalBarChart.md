# Vertical Bar Chart #

* Commonly used to present high density data such as logs and a network traffic
* As description on the Kiabana user interface suggests: "if you are not sure which chart you need, you could do worse than to start here"
* I wish it was listed as first option on the Visualize tab
* Metrics are similar to Data Table and Metric visualization - numeric value to present
* Buckets are similar to aggregation in Data Table - a way to partition the data
* Two options to consider: Split Bars or Split Chart
* Not extremely intuitive user interface and/or configuration options
